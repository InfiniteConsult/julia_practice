```julia
# 0019_short_circuit_guard.jl

# A simple data structure to hold a value.
mutable struct Container
    value::Int
end

# This function safely processes a container.
# The variable 'obj' can either be a 'Container' or 'nothing'.
function process_container(obj)
    # This is a "guard clause" using short-circuiting.
    # The second part, 'obj.value > 10', is ONLY evaluated if the first part is true.
    if obj !== nothing && obj.value > 10
        println("Processing container with high value: ", obj.value)

println("\n--- Processing 'nothing' ---")
# Without the short-circuit guard, `c2.value` would cause a crash.

### Explanation

This script demonstrates a practical and critical use of the `&&` operator's short-circuiting behavior: creating a **guard clause**.

  * **The Problem**: In many languages, you might have a variable that could be `null` (or `None` in Python). In Julia, the equivalent is `nothing`. If you try to access a member of `nothing` (e.g., `nothing.value`), your program will crash.

  * **The Solution**: Short-circuiting provides an elegant and performant solution. In the line `if obj !== nothing && obj.value > 10`:

    1.  Julia first evaluates `obj !== nothing`. The `!==` operator is the negation of `===` (strict identity) and is the standard way to check if something is not `nothing`.
    2.  If `obj` is `nothing`, this expression is `false`. Because this is an `&&` (AND) operation, the entire condition *must* be false, so Julia **stops evaluating** and does not execute the right side.
    3.  The right side, `obj.value > 10`, is only ever reached if the first check passed, guaranteeing that `obj` is a valid `Container` object and that accessing `.value` is safe.

This pattern is fundamental in Julia (and many other languages) for writing robust code that gracefully handles potentially missing values.

To run the script:

```shell
$ julia 0019_short_circuit_guard.jl
--- Processing a valid container ---
Processing container with high value: 20

--- Processing 'nothing' ---
Skipping, object is either nothing or its value is not > 10.
```
