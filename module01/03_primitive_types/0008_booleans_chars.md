### `0008_booleans_chars.jl`

```julia
# 0008_booleans_chars.jl

# Booleans can be 'true' or 'false'
is_active = true
is_complete = false

println("Value of is_active: ", is_active, ", Type: ", typeof(is_active))
println("Value of is_complete: ", is_complete, ", Type: ", typeof(is_complete))

println("-"^20)

# Characters are created with single quotes and represent a single Unicode code point
letter_a = 'a'
unicode_char = 'Î©' # Greek letter Omega

println("Value of letter_a: ", letter_a, ", Type: ", typeof(letter_a))
println("Value of unicode_char: ", unicode_char, ", Type: ", typeof(unicode_char))

# A Julia Char is a 32-bit primitive type, which can be seen by converting it to an integer
codepoint = UInt32(unicode_char)
println("The Unicode codepoint for 'Î©' is: ", codepoint)
```

### Explanation

This script covers two fundamental primitive types: booleans and characters.

  * **`Bool`**: The boolean type has two possible instances: `true` and `false`. It is used for logical operations and control flow.

  * **`Char`**: A character literal is created using **single quotes** (e.g., `'a'`). This distinguishes it from strings, which use double quotes.

### Important Distinction for C/C++ Programmers

A crucial difference from C/C++ is that a Julia `Char` is **not** an 8-bit integer. It is a special 32-bit primitive type that represents a single Unicode code point. This allows any Unicode character, from 'a' to 'Î©' to 'ðŸ˜‚', to be stored in a `Char` variable without ambiguity. You can convert a `Char` to its corresponding integer value to see its code point.

To run the script:

```shell
$ julia 0008_booleans_chars.jl
Value of is_active: true, Type: Bool
Value of is_complete: false, Type: Bool
--------------------
Value of letter_a: a, Type: Char
Value of unicode_char: Î©, Type: Char
The Unicode codepoint for 'Î©' is: 937
