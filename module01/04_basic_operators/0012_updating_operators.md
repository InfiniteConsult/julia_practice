### Explanation

This script demonstrates Julia's updating operators, which provide a concise syntax for modifying a variable in place. These operators are syntactically and functionally identical to their counterparts in C, C++, Rust, and Python.

  * **Syntax**: An updating operator is a combination of a binary operator (like `+`, `-`, `*`) and the assignment operator (`=`). The expression `x += y` is a shorthand for `x = x + y`.

  * **Common Operators**: Julia supports a wide range of these operators, including:

      * `+=` (add and assign)
      * `-=` (subtract and assign)
      * `*=` (multiply and assign)
      * `/=` (divide and assign)
      * `รท=` (integer divide and assign)
      * `%=` (remainder and assign)
      * `^=` (exponentiate and assign)

  * **Type Promotion**: Be aware that the operation can change the type of the variable. As shown in the example, when `counter /= 4` is executed, the `/` operator performs floating-point division. The result is a `Float64`, so the `counter` variable is rebound to this new floating-point value.

To run the script:

```shell
$ julia 0012_updating_operators.jl
Initial counter value: 10
After 'counter += 5': 15
After 'counter -= 3': 12
After 'counter *= 2': 24
After 'counter /= 4': 6.0
New type of counter: Float64
```
