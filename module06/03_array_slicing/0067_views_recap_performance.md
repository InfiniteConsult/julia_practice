# Import necessary tools
# BenchmarkTools is not in the standard library, so we need to add it.
# See Explanation section for installation instructions.
import BenchmarkTools: @btime

# 1. A function that processes a vector (e.g., calculates sum)
# We make it type-stable by annotating the input.
function process_data(data::AbstractVector{Float64})
    total = 0.0

# 2. Create a large vector
N = 1_000_000 # 1 million elements

# 4. Benchmark passing a slice (A[start:end])
# This creates a *new* vector containing a copy of the elements.

### Explanation

This script revisits **array slicing** and **views**, focusing explicitly on the **performance implications**. It uses the `BenchmarkTools.jl` package to provide accurate measurements, demonstrating why views (`@view`) are essential for high-performance code.

-----

**Installation Note:**

This lesson uses `BenchmarkTools.jl`, which is not part of Julia's standard library. You need to add it to your environment once.

1.  Start the Julia REPL: `julia`
2.  Enter Pkg mode by typing `]` at the `julia>` prompt. The prompt will change to `pkg>`.
3.  Type `add BenchmarkTools` and press Enter. Julia will download and install the package.
4.  Exit Pkg mode by pressing Backspace or `Ctrl+C`.
5.  You can now run this script.

  * **Recap: Slice vs. View**

      * **Slice (`A[start:end]`):** Creates a **new** `Array` object, allocates fresh memory, and **copies** the selected elements from the original array into the new one. This is memory-intensive and CPU-intensive if the slice is large or done frequently.
      * **View (`@view A[start:end]`):** Creates a lightweight `SubArray` object. This object does **not** allocate memory for the data itself; it simply holds a **reference** to the *original* array and stores the selected indices. It is a zero-copy, zero-allocation operation.

  * **Benchmarking with `@btime`:**

      * The `@btime` macro (from `BenchmarkTools.jl`) is the standard tool for accurate performance measurement in Julia. It runs the expression many times, measures the minimum execution time, and reports memory allocations.
      * **Crucial Interpolation (`$`):** Notice `original_vector[$start_idx:$end_idx]` inside `@btime`. The `$` is **essential** here. It tells `@btime` to treat `original_vector`, `start_idx`, and `end_idx` as pre-computed *values* rather than global variables to be looked up inside the timing loop. Without the `$`, you would be benchmarking global variable access time, polluting the results.

  * **Interpreting the Results:**

      * **Slice Benchmark:** The `@btime` output for the slice will show a significant amount of **memory allocation** (e.g., `allocs: 1`) and a non-trivial execution time. This time includes the cost of allocating the new vector, copying half a million `Float64`s, and *then* running `process_data`.
      * **View Benchmark:** The `@btime` output for the `@view` will show **zero memory allocations** (`allocs: 0`) and a significantly **faster** execution time. This time represents *only* the cost of running `process_data` directly on the relevant portion of the original data.
      * **`Base.mightalias`:** This function returning `true` confirms that the view object potentially shares memory with the original vector (which it does).

  * **Performance Guideline (HFT Context):**
    In performance-critical code, especially within loops or functions called frequently, **always use views (`@view`) when you need to pass a portion of an array to another function without needing an independent copy**. Slicing (`A[start:end]`) should only be used when you explicitly require a separate, mutable copy of the data. Unnecessary copying is a major source of avoidable overhead and GC pressure.

  * **References:**

      * **Julia Official Documentation, Manual, "Multi-dimensional Arrays", "Views (SubArrays and other relevant types)":** Explains the concept of `SubArray` and the `@view` macro.
      * **Julia Official Documentation, `BenchmarkTools.jl`:** Describes the usage of `@btime` and the importance of variable interpolation (`$`).

To run the script:

*(You must first install `BenchmarkTools.jl` as described above.)*

```shell
$ julia 0067_views_recap_performance.jl 
--- Benchmarking Slice (Copying) ---
  293.589 μs (5 allocations: 3.81 MiB)

--- Benchmarking View (Zero-Copy) ---
  185.664 μs (3 allocations: 96 bytes)

Type of view object: SubArray{Float64, 1, Vector{Float64}, Tuple{UnitRange{Int64}}, true}
Does view share memory with original? true

```

*(Replace `### μs minimum time: X/Y ###` with the actual timings you observe. Time X should be significantly larger than Time Y, and allocations should be 1 vs 0.)*
