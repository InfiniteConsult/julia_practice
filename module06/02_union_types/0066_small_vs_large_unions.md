While `Union` types are a powerful feature, their performance characteristics depend heavily on **how many types** are included in the `Union` and **whether those types are `isbits`**. There is a significant performance difference between "small" and "large" unions.

## Small `isbits` Unions (Fast) ‚ú®

* **Example:** `Union{Int64, Nothing}`, `Union{Float64, Bool}`, `Union{Int8, UInt8}`
* **Performance:** **Excellent**.
* **Why? Compiler Optimization:** Julia's compiler has specific, highly effective optimizations for `Union`s that contain a small number (typically 2-3) of `isbits` types (and/or `Nothing`).
    * **Inline Storage:** As seen in the previous lesson, the compiler can often store the value **inline** within the memory allocated for the variable or struct field. It allocates enough space for the largest `isbits` member.
    * **Type Tag:** An extra hidden **type tag byte** is stored alongside the inline data. This byte efficiently encodes *which* of the possible types is currently stored.
    * **Fast Dispatch:** Checking the type (e.g., `if x === nothing`) becomes a simple, fast check of this tag byte, often compiling down to a single conditional branch instruction.
    * **No Boxing:** There is generally no heap allocation ("boxing") required for these small unions when used, for example, as struct fields or array elements.

**Use Case:** Ideal for representing optional values (`Union{T, Nothing}`), return codes (`Union{Result, ErrorCode}`), or situations where a value can be one of just a few simple types.

## Large Unions or Unions with Non-`isbits` Types (Slow) üêå

* **Example:** `Union{Int64, Float64, String}`, `Union{Int64, Vector{Float64}}`, `Union{Circle, Rectangle, MutableSquare}` (from Module 5)
* **Performance:** **Poor**, approaching the performance of `Any`.
* **Why? Lack of Optimization:** The compiler's inline storage + type tag optimization breaks down or becomes inefficient when:
    1.  **Too Many Types:** Checking the type tag requires a complex series of branches (e.g., "is it type 1? no. is it type 2? no. is it type 3? ..."). This significantly slows down dispatch.
    2.  **Non-`isbits` Members:** If the `Union` includes non-`isbits` types (like `String`, `Vector`, or `mutable struct`s), these types *must* be heap-allocated anyway. The compiler often cannot store them inline. It must fall back to storing a **pointer** to the heap-allocated object, similar to how `Any` works. This involves **boxing** and **pointer chasing**.
    3.  **Variable Size:** If the types in the `Union` have different sizes, efficient inline storage becomes impossible.

**Performance Impact:**
* **Boxing:** Values might be heap-allocated ("boxed") even if they are simple types like `Int`.
* **Dynamic Dispatch:** Using a value from a large `Union` almost always requires slow, runtime dynamic dispatch.
* **Type Instability:** Functions returning large `Union`s are inherently type-unstable, preventing compiler specialization and optimization.

**Guideline:** Avoid large unions in performance-critical code. If a variable or field truly needs to hold many different types, it often indicates a design issue. Consider using abstract types with multiple dispatch (as in Module 5) or redesigning your data structures. Small, `isbits`-based unions are a targeted optimization; large unions are generally an anti-pattern for performance.
