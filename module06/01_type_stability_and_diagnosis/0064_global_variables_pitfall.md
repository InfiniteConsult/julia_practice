### Explanation

This script revisits a critical performance pitfall: accessing **non-constant global variables** from within functions. It demonstrates why this leads to type instability and how the `const` keyword solves the problem.

  * **The Problem: Non-`const` Globals**

      * When you define a global variable like `non_const_global = 100`, you are telling the compiler very little. The type of this variable could change at *any moment* during the program's execution (as shown when we reassign it to a `String`).
      * Inside the function `use_non_const_global()`, when the compiler sees `non_const_global * 2`, it has **no way to know** what type `non_const_global` will have *at runtime*. It cannot specialize the code. It must generate slow, generic code that:
        1.  Looks up the current value and type of `non_const_global` **at runtime**.
        2.  Performs **dynamic dispatch** to find the correct `*` method for whatever type it found.

  * **Diagnosis with `@code_warntype`:**

      * Running `@code_warntype use_non_const_global()` confirms this instability. The output will show `Body::Any` (or some other non-concrete type, often in red). This is the compiler telling you it cannot predict the return type because it depends on the unpredictable type of the global variable.

  * **The Solution: `const` Globals**

      * The `const const_global = 200` declaration is a **promise** to the compiler: "The *type* of `const_global` will *always* be `Int64`." (Note: If `const_global` was a mutable object like a `Vector`, its *contents* could still change, but it would always *refer* to that same `Vector`).
      * Inside `use_const_global()`, the compiler now **knows for certain** that `const_global` is an `Int64`. It can generate fast, specialized machine code that directly multiplies two integers.

  * **Diagnosis with `@code_warntype`:**

      * Running `@code_warntype use_const_global()` shows the fix. The output will be `Body::Int64` (green). The compiler is confident about the return type because the global's type is guaranteed.

  * **Rule of Thumb:** **Always** declare global variables used in performance-critical code as `const`. If you need a global whose *type* might change, reconsider your design â€“ perhaps pass it as a function argument instead. Accessing non-`const` globals is one of the most common and easily fixed sources of poor performance in Julia.

  * **References:**

      * **Julia Official Documentation, Manual, "Performance Tips":** "Avoid global variables." and "Declare variables as constant." These sections explicitly warn about the performance cost and recommend `const`.

To run the script:
