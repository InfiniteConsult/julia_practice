### `0036_pairs.jl`

```julia
# 0036_pairs.jl

# 1. The `=>` syntax is a convenient way to create a `Pair` object.
pair_obj = (200 => "OK")

println("Value of the pair object: ", pair_obj)
println("Type of the pair object: ", typeof(pair_obj))

# A Pair is a simple struct with 'first' and 'second' fields.
println("First element: ", pair_obj.first)
println("Second element: ", pair_obj.second)

println("-"^20)

# 2. A Dict is fundamentally a collection of these Pair objects.
#    The following two definitions are completely equivalent.
dict_syntax = Dict(404 => "Not Found", 500 => "Internal Server Error")

pair1 = Pair(404, "Not Found")
pair2 = Pair(500, "Internal Server Error")
dict_constructor = Dict(pair1, pair2)

println("Dicts are equivalent: ", dict_syntax == dict_constructor)
```

### Explanation

This script clarifies the relationship between the `=>` syntax, the `Pair` object, and the `Dict` data structure.

  * **`Pair` Object**: The `=>` operator is just syntactic sugar for creating a `Pair` object. A `Pair` is a simple, immutable struct that holds two values, accessible via the fields `.first` and `.second`. `key => value` is equivalent to `Pair(key, value)`.

  * **`Dict` and `Pair`**: A dictionary is, at its core, a hash table that stores a collection of `Pair` objects. When you write `Dict(key1 => val1, key2 => val2)`, you are simply creating several `Pair` objects and passing them to the `Dict` constructor to be stored.

Understanding that `=>` creates a `Pair` helps demystify how dictionaries are constructed and how iteration works. When you iterate over a dictionary, as in `for (k, v) in my_dict`, you are iterating over the `Pair`s it contains, and Julia's destructuring assignment automatically unpacks each `Pair` into the `k` and `v` variables.

To run the script:

```shell
$ julia 0036_pairs.jl
Value of the pair object: 200 => "OK"
Type of the pair object: Pair{Int64, String}
First element: 200
Second element: OK
--------------------
Dicts are equivalent: true
```
