### `0001_hello_world.jl`

```julia
# 0001_hello_world.jl

println("Hello, World!")
```

### Explanation

This script introduces the most fundamental function for displaying output in Julia: `println()`.

  * **`println()`**: This function takes one or more arguments, prints their string representation to the console, and automatically appends a newline character at the end.
  * **Strings**: Text literals, like `"Hello, World!"`, are created using double quotes.
  * **Comments**: Lines beginning with `#` are single-line comments and are ignored by the interpreter.

To run this script, save it as `0001_hello_world.jl` and execute it from your terminal:

```shell
$ julia 0001_hello_world.jl
Hello, World!
```
