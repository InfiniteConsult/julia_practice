```julia
# 0047_do_blocks.jl
using Printf

# 1. A function that takes another function as its first argument.
#    This simulates managing a resource (like opening/closing a file).
function with_resource(func::Function, resource_name::String)
    println("Acquiring resource: ", resource_name)
    resource_id = rand(1000:9999) # Simulate getting a resource handle
    try
        # Execute the function passed in, giving it the resource ID
        result = func(resource_id)
        println("Function executed, result: ", result)
    catch e
        println("An error occurred: ", e)
    finally
        # Ensure the resource is always released, even if an error occurs.
        println("Releasing resource: ", resource_name, " (ID: ", resource_id, ")")
    end
end

# 2. Call `with_resource` using a standard anonymous function argument.
println("--- Calling with standard anonymous function ---")
with_resource(id -> @sprintf("Processing resource %d", id), "MyData")

println("\n" * "-"^20 * "\n")

# 3. Call `with_resource` using the 'do' block syntax.
#    This is syntactic sugar for the above, especially useful for multi-line functions.
println("--- Calling with 'do' block ---")
with_resource("MyData") do id
    # This block of code is automatically turned into an anonymous function
    # that takes 'id' as its argument.
    println("Inside the do block, working with ID: ", id)
    processed_data = @sprintf("Processed resource %d successfully", id)
    # The last expression is implicitly returned from the anonymous function
    processed_data
end

### Explanation

This script introduces the **`do` block** syntax, which is a convenient and readable way to pass a multi-line anonymous function as the *first* argument to another function. It's commonly used for managing resources safely, similar to Python's `with` statement or RAII in C++. 📝

  * **The Pattern**: Julia functions that manage resources (like opening files, network connections, or temporary directories) often follow a pattern: they take a function as their first argument. This function represents the code the user wants to execute *while* the resource is available. The managing function is responsible for setting up the resource before calling the user's function and guaranteeing cleanup afterwards, even if errors occur.

  * **`with_resource` Function**: Our example function `with_resource(func, resource_name)` simulates this pattern. It acquires a dummy resource (an ID), uses a `try...finally` block to ensure cleanup, and calls the provided `func`, passing it the resource ID.

  * **Standard Anonymous Function Call**: The first call shows the standard way to pass an anonymous function: `with_resource(id -> ..., "MyData")`. This works fine for simple, one-line functions.

  * **`do` Block Syntax**: The second call demonstrates the `do` block:

    ```julia
    with_resource("MyData") do id
        # Code block...
    end
    ```

    This is **syntactic sugar** that Julia automatically rewrites into the standard anonymous function call.

      * The arguments before `do` (`"MyData"`) become the arguments *after* the function argument in the actual call.
      * The variable(s) after `do` (`id`) become the argument(s) to the anonymous function.
      * The code between `do` and `end` becomes the body of the anonymous function.

  * **Readability**: The `do` block is much more readable for multi-line operations, as it avoids deeply nested parentheses and clearly separates the resource being managed from the code operating on it.

  * **Resource Management**: This pattern, often used with `do`, ensures resources are properly released. The `finally` block in `with_resource` guarantees the "Releasing resource" message prints, whether the code inside the `do` block succeeds or throws an error.

To run the script:

```shell
$ julia 0047_do_blocks.jl
--- Calling with standard anonymous function ---
Acquiring resource: MyData
Function executed, result: Processing resource <ID>
Releasing resource: MyData (ID: <ID>)

--------------------

--- Calling with 'do' block ---
Acquiring resource: MyData
Inside the do block, working with ID: <ID>
Function executed, result: Processed resource <ID> successfully
Releasing resource: MyData (ID: <ID>)
```

*(Note: `<ID>` will be a random 4-digit number)*
