```julia
# 0041_multiple_dispatch_basics.jl

# 1. Define a function name 'process'.
#    We will define several *methods* for this function name.

# Method 1: Specific for Int arguments.
function process(data::Int)
    println("Processing an Integer: ", data * 2)
end

# Method 2: Specific for String arguments.
function process(data::String)
    println("Processing a String: ", uppercase(data))
end

# Method 3: A generic fallback for any other type (Any).
# 'Any' is the top-level abstract type in Julia.
function process(data::Any)
    println("Processing data of generic type '", typeof(data), "': ", data)
end

# 2. Call the function with different argument types.
#    Julia automatically selects the MOST specific method available at runtime.
println("--- Calling process() with different types ---")
process(10)          # Calls Method 1
process("hello")     # Calls Method 2
process(3.14)        # Calls Method 3 (Float64 is a subtype of Any)
process([1, 2, 3])   # Calls Method 3 (Vector{Int64} is a subtype of Any)

### Explanation

This script introduces **multiple dispatch**, the central organizing principle of Julia üèõÔ∏è. It's Julia's answer to function overloading (like in C++) and method overriding (like in Python/Java), but it's more general and powerful.

  * **Functions vs. Methods**: In Julia, you define a **function** by its name (e.g., `process`). You then define one or more **methods** for that function, where each method specifies the *types* of arguments it accepts using type annotations (e.g., `process(data::Int)`).

  * **Dispatch**: When you call a function like `process(10)`, Julia looks at the **runtime types** of all the arguments you provided. It then selects and executes the **most specific method** whose type signature matches those arguments.

      * `process(10)` matches `process(data::Int)`.
      * `process("hello")` matches `process(data::String)`.
      * `process(3.14)` doesn't match `Int` or `String`, so it falls back to the least specific method that matches, which is `process(data::Any)`.

  * **Why it's "Multiple"**: Unlike object-oriented languages where dispatch usually happens only on the first argument (`object.method()`), Julia considers the types of **all** arguments when selecting the method. This is why it's called *multiple* dispatch.

  * **Performance**: Multiple dispatch is not just elegant; it's also **fast**. Because the method selection happens based on concrete types, the Julia JIT compiler can generate highly optimized, direct calls to the specific machine code for that method, completely avoiding the overhead of dynamic lookups often associated with traditional object-oriented method calls.

Multiple dispatch encourages writing small, reusable functions that operate on different data types, leading to highly composable and performant code.

To run the script:

```shell
$ julia 0041_multiple_dispatch_basics.jl
--- Calling process() with different types ---
Processing an Integer: 20
Processing a String: HELLO
Processing data of generic type 'Float64': 3.14
Processing data of generic type 'Vector{Int64}': [1, 2, 3]
```
